User Stories:

Marketing Research Team:
1.  As part of the marketing research team, we want data to be displayed so that we can see what the most popular products are.
2.  As part of the marketing research team, we want the data to be represented in a clean graphic so that it is easy to see the results of our marketing experiment.
3.  As part of the marketing research team, we want the most accurate results possible, and so it is important to organize the images in the most unbiased way possible, so that no image is larger or pops out anymore than the other (as that may be the reason people will choose a product)
4.  As part of the marketing research team, we want the data to actually reflect what is going on in the graphic and behind the scenes as track is kept of what product is the most wanted.  Implement accurate calculations and percentages that will reflect the actual results of the application.

Developer:
1.  As a developer, I want to satisfy the marketing research team with the product that they are paying me to create for them.  I must style it so that the application is presentable and not on a subpar effort compared to other applications.
2.  As a developer, I want to make sure the focus group participants do not give biased results, and so I will not reveal the data or results of the application until after 25 selections have been made.
3.  As a developer, I want to display data that is meaningful and in helpful context.  I will use percentages to reflect what was the most successful product and the the graphic will make it easy for anyone to see which product strived the most.
4.  As a developer, I want the focus group to be able to directly see what products they are choosing between, which means that all images will be fitted to the same size and ratio, and the images will be laid in order and be able to be seen upon opening the  front page of the application.

Focus Group Participants:
1.  As a focus group participant, I want all three images/products to be displayed in a neat manner on the webpage and without any huge distractions.  This is so that other participants and I can quickly distinguish and choose what product I would purchase (a more efficient and to the point webpage/application is important)
2.  As a focus group participant, I want to avoid all bias possible when it comes to choosing a product, so all images should be fitted to the same size and ratio, and also all be displayed together.
3.  As a focus group participant, I want to avoid all forms of bias so that I choose the product that I would actually purchase, and this can be done by not releasing any data that suggests what anyone else chose until 25 suggestions have already been made for th best products.
4.  As a focus group participant, I want to see a website that been styled appropriately and is not a basic blank page
